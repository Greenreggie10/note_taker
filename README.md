[Application deployed on Heroku](https://rocky-peak-57930.herokuapp.com/)

The link above connects to the the heroku app. once you access heroku and  efficently create a user friendly code to note important imformation about  
there small business 


## !-- Usage  -->        
I was provided some basic front end files for a note taking app and asked to use Express.js to set up a server and write the API and HTML routes that would allow the user to get the list of notes and add new notes.

The plus sign icon at the top right of the screen allows the user to start writing a new note, and the floppy disk icon that pops up beside it lets the user save that new note.

I was also challenged to write a delete route that would allow the user to delete a note from the list by clicking the red trash can icon beside it. I managed to update the code to let that work (with an additional page refresh after each deletion), but the functionality is spotty on the Heroku deployment for reasons I haven't yet figured out. I'll need further testing to troubleshoot that issue.
